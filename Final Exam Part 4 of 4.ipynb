    "A computer company checks every computer it produces before shipping. Each computer undergoes a series of 100 tests. The number of tests it fails will be used to determine whether the computer is Good or Defective. If it fails more than a certain number, it will be classified as Defective and will not be shipped. From past history, the distribution of the number of tests failed is known for both Good and Defective computers. The probabilities associated with each outcome are listed in the table below:\n",
